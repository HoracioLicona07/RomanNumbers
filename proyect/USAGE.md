This demonstrates that the program correctly converts Roman numerals to their decimal equivalents.

### Limitations
- The program is designed to handle Roman numerals representing values from 1 to 100. It does not validate if the input string is a valid Roman numeral.
- The implementation assumes well-formed Roman numerals as input.

## Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the program, use the following commands:

```bash
javac RomanToDecimal.java
java com.example.RomanToDecimal
